Hey! I'm Vaibhav! 👋🏻 I'm an aspiring data scientist dedicated to finding insights in data as well as educating others in data analytics! Let's connect!

📊 I was first introduced to the world of Data Analytics while working as a software developer in IT sector for a Fortune 500 company. Although, at that time, the term Data science wasn’t this famous. Nonetheless, I understood that any industry generated a lot of data and not tapping into them is a waste of valuable insights. I was working as an iOS developer but used automation and app data to generate insights.

🔬 Fast forward to now, I am currently pursuing my Master’s at Concordia University in Software Engineering. I have taken various courses expanding my horizon in the fields of Machine Learning and Big data analytics.

💻 Always eager to learn new things and taking up new challenges, currently I'm taking up various online courses and participating in hackathons to gain experience in the field of data science and data analytics. I am also exploring multiple domains to further enhance my skills and choose where I want to end up in the future.

🙂 A little about my personality: I am the type of person who will ask “What can I do to help and improve?” when presented with a problem and will pitch in whenever needed to find out of box solutions to existing processes. I am energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see improvement. I strongly believe in giving back to society and uplift everyone around me.


💬 Message me to talk about: how to get started in data science, what's it like pursuing master’s at Concordia or in Canada, what resources I am using to learn data science, and how to stay motivated when you are self-learning even if you aren’t from a computer science background.
